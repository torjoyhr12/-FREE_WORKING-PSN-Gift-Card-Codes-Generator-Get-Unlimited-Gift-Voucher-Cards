How do I add an e-Gift Card to my PSN account?
There are two modes for receiving e-Gift cards:




E-mail: Gift Card ordered through the email delivery mode will be delivered to the email address entered by the purchaser during the order purchase. You can directly add an e-mail Gift Card from your email by clicking on the Add to my Account button
Shared via link: You can directly add a Gift Card shared via link by clicking on the Add to Account button




You will be asked to login to your Amazon account and your Gift Card funds will be automatically added to Your Account.

You can also add the Gift Card to Balance by visiting 'Add Gift Card ' Page on Amazon Pay Dashboard. Enter the 14-digit alpha-numeric code and click on 'Add Gift Card to Balance'

Note: An e-Gift Card (E-mail or Share via link) Code is 14 characters long and contains both letters and numbers (for example AS25-NZ1JX-CZCP5). The Gift Card equivalent value gets added to your Amazon Pay balance. You can track the balance of your Gift Cards here.
